# ATM-MACHINE-(Mini Project)-Java
ATM systems, also known as cash machines or ATMs, are electronic devices that allow individuals to perform a range of financial transactions without the need for human assistance. Initially introduced as a means to withdraw cash, ATMs have evolved to offer a wide array of services, making them a cornerstone of modern banking.

This project is an ATM machine simulator developed in Java, showcasing the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project includes functionalities such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit, and transaction history. The project is designed with a focus on encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## Features
- **Balance Inquiry:** Check the current balance of the account.
- **Cash Withdrawal:** Withdraw a specified amount from the account.
- **Deposit:** Deposit a specified amount into the account.
- **Transaction History:** View the history of transactions made on the account.
- **Security:** Implement basic security features such as PIN verification.

## Technical Details
- **Language:** Java
- **Concepts:** OOP, HashCode
- **Database:** This project does not use a database for storage. Instead, it uses in-memory data storage to demonstrate core concepts.
- **User Interface:** Command-line interface (CLI)

## Topics
- Java
- OOP
- ATM Simulation
- Command-Line Application
- HashCode

## Working of ATM Program in Java
Letâ€™s check out the working of each operation:

- **Withdraw:** The withdrawal process involves obtaining the withdrawal amount from the user, deducting it from the userâ€™s account balance, and displaying a message confirming the successful withdrawal and providing transaction details.

- **Deposit:** This operation allows users to deposit funds into their account. It involves getting the deposit amount from the user, adding it to their account balance, and displaying a message confirming the successful deposit and providing transaction details.

- **Check the balance:** This operation allows users to view their current account balance by retrieving their total balance and displaying it on the screen, allowing the user to view their available funds.

- **Exit:** The user can exit the current transaction mode by closing any open connections or terminating the application, which may include closing any open connections or terminating the application.

It is important to ensure proper input validation, handle error conditions, and maintain the integrity and security of user transactions in the ATM Program in Java.

Importance and Functionality of ATM Programs:
Convenience and Accessibility
Time-saving and Efficiency
Enhanced Financial Control
Cash Management
Integration with Banking Services

Overall, the code provides a basic implementation of an ATM program in Java, allowing users to perform essential banking operations.
